/**
 * These rules assign a Build ID to Unassigned Workflow Executions and
 * Activities.
 * Specifically, assignment rules are applied to the following Executions or
 * Activities when they are scheduled in a Task Queue:
 *    - Generally, any new Workflow Execution, except:
 *      - When A Child Workflow or a Continue-As-New Execution inherits the
 *        Build ID from its parent/previous execution by setting the
 *        `inherit_build_id` flag.
 *      - Workflow Executions started Eagerly are assigned to the Build ID of
 *        the Starter.
 *    - An Activity that is scheduled on a Task Queue different from the one
 *      their Workflow runs on, unless the `use_workflow_build_id` flag is set.
 * In absence of (applicable) redirect rules (`CompatibleBuildIdRedirectRule`s)
 * the task will be dispatched to Workers of the Build ID determined by the
 * assignment rules. Otherwise, the final Build ID will be determined by the
 * redirect rules.
 * When using Worker Versioning, in the steady state, for a given Task Queue,
 * there should typically be exactly one assignment rule to send all Unassigned
 * tasks to the latest Build ID. Existence of at least one such "unconditional"
 * rule at all times is enforce by the system, unless the `force` flag is used
 * by the user when replacing/deleting these rules (for exceptional cases).
 * During a deployment, one or more additional rules can be added to assign a
 * subset of the tasks to a new Build ID based on a "ramp percentage".
 * When there are multiple assignment rules for a Task Queue, the rules are
 * evaluated in order, starting from index 0. The first applicable rule will be
 * applied and the rest will be ignored.
 * In the event that no assignment rule is applicable on a task (or the Task
 * Queue is simply not versioned), the tasks will be sent to unversioned
 * workers, if available. Otherwise, they remain Unassigned, and will be
 * retried for assignment, or dispatch to unversioned workers, at a later time
 * depending on the availability of workers.
